AddZip Plugin for rutorrent

This plugin allows you to add a Zip file of torrents using the rutorrent interface.

Place all the plugin files in a directory called 'addzip' in the rutorrent/plugins directory.

To clone directly from this git repository, run this command in the rutorrent/plugins directory:

git clone https://github.com/Micdu70/rutorrent-addzip.git addzip

Note: It is important that the plugin directory is named 'addzip' so that the supporting files are loaded correctly.

The uploaded zip file is searched recursively and any torrent files are added to rtorrent.

Useful for adding torrents in bulk.
